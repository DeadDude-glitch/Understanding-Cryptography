# Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm Overview

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks. It utilizes a **Feistel Network** structure, where the plaintext is processed through multiple rounds of substitution and permutation.

## 1. Initial and Final Permutations

* **Initial Permutation (IP):** Before the main processing rounds begin, the 64-bit input block undergoes a fixed permutation. This does not enhance security mathematically but prepares the data for the Feistel structure.
* **Final Permutation (FP):** This is the exact inverse of the Initial Permutation ($IP^{-1}$). It is applied after the final round of processing to produce the 64-bit ciphertext.

## 2. The Feistel Structure (L and R Registers)

After the Initial Permutation, the 64-bit block is split into two 32-bit halves:

* **L (Left):** The left 32 bits of the block.
* **R (Right):** The right 32 bits of the block.

In each round, the new $R$ value is calculated by XORing the old $L$ value with the output of the **Round Function (f)**. The new $L$ value simply becomes the old $R$ value.

## 3. The Round Function (f)

The core of DES security lies in the function $f$, which operates on the 32-bit Right register and a 48-bit subkey. It consists of four primary stages:

### A. Expansion/Permutation (EP)

The 32-bit $R$ register is expanded to 48 bits. This is achieved by duplicating certain bits. This expansion allows the data to match the size of the subkey and increases the diffusion of bits.

### B. Key Mixing (XOR)

The 48-bit result from the expansion is combined with a **48-bit Round Key** (generated by the Key Schedule) using a bitwise XOR operation.

### C. S-Boxes (Substitution)

This is the most critical step for security as it provides **non-linearity**.

* The 48-bit input is divided into eight 6-bit chunks.
* Each chunk is processed by one of eight unique **S-Boxes**.
* Each S-Box maps its 6-bit input to a 4-bit output, resulting in a 32-bit total output.

### D. Permutation (P)

The 32-bit output from the S-Boxes undergoes a final fixed permutation (P-Box). This ensures that the bits from a single S-Box are spread across different positions in the next round, enhancing the "avalanche effect."

## 4. Key Schedule

DES uses a 64-bit initial key, but only **56 bits** are used for security (8 bits are parity bits). The Key Schedule performs:

1. **Permuted Choice 1 (PC-1):** Discards parity bits and permutes the remaining 56 bits.
2. **Left Circular Shifts:** Depending on the round number, the key halves are shifted.
3. **Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2):** Selects a 48-bit subset of the shifted key to be used as the **Round Key** for that specific round.
